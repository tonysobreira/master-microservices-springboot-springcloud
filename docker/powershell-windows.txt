RECOMMENDATION : Use PowerShell in Windows!
Recommendation 1

If you are using Windows, make sure that you use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt.



Recommendation 2

If you are using Window 10 and are using docker toolbox

=> Use 192.168.99.100 instead of localhost.

Note: If 192.168.99.100 does not work, you can find the IP by using the command docker-machine ip



Reason

In Window 10 when using docker toolbox, docker is configured to use the default machine with IP 192.168.99.100
